If you haven't heard of Marie Kondo, you must be living in a bubble. Her recent show on Netflix, "Tidying Up with Marie Kondo" has been extremely popular and sparked a lot of debate online. The show involves her going to people's homes, specifically in California, and helping families clear and organise their belonging. She invented the KonMari method for achieving this.

While watching the show, I thought about how we could apply her method to writing and maintaining code. Over time, projects can build up a lot of dead code, or the quality of the code starts to suffer.

- Does this code spark joy?
- Compartmenting code
- Clearing out stuff you don't need before tidying
- Tidy by category, not location
- Low hanging fruit
- Declutter code, but also mind
